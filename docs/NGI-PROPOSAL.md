# NGI Commons Proposal: Godfather Ranker

## Project Summary

**Godfather Ranker** is an open-source unified SEO analytics dashboard that breaks the €500M North American monopoly (Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz) by providing European SMEs with affordable, FOSS-based analytics access.

## Problem

- **€500/month** for fragmented tools
- **3M EU SMEs** unable to afford professional analytics
- **Zero FOSS alternatives** in unified dashboard space
- **Manual consolidation** = 10+ hours wasted/week

## Solution

Single, unified dashboard:
- Google Analytics 4 + Search Console + Apify actors
- Real-time rank tracking + competitor intelligence
- €10/mo freemium vs €500 monopolies

## Impact

- **3M SMEs** gain access to pro analytics
- **€1.5B annual** economic value (€500/mo × 3M saved)
- **100% FOSS** - community-driven development

## Budget: €45,000 (4 months)
- 1 Full-stack Developer
- MVP launch + community onboarding
